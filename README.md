	|- Summary of the Lab in my Own Words
        |- In Lab7 we programmed a toaster oven that has 3 features, bake, broil and toast
		|- Initially I started with programming the display, which displays the digital oven
		|- with a tray rack in the center and 3 Sections to the right consisting of 
		|- Mode:, Time:, Temp:. Mode is generated from a pointer list where I used variables
		|- from the OvenData Struct to increment through the list to display the desired mode
		|- This list is vital as most settings programmed such as the cook display and the
		|- ability to access temperature hinges on this. The LED would then be lit up and
		|- count down when it has reach an eigth of the remaining time. Some important aspects
		|- of this lab that I thought were important were the knowledge this gives us on how
		|- code interacts with ciruitry, as well as the significant of Hz to displays.
    |- What was your approach?
        |- My approach to the lab was mostly fustrated cries, as I strugged to understand how the linking
        |- I was eventually able to pull through thanks to the hints on discord as people would discuss
        |- the lab in addition to sitting in on LAB sections. I first started with displaying the contents
	|- of the example display but ran into issues as I was unable to display time and temp initially
	|- this brought upon more pain as I wrestled with my code to properly read from the potentometer.
	|- Next came the Switch function, then the LEDS but as I got more and more code down the rest became
	|- less and less difficuilt.
        |- Somethings I messed up on was starting late as I was fighting against time
    |- Results
        |- In the end I was able to complete the lab, although the buttom were a bit finicky I chalked it up to
	|- my pickit3 being a butt and not at optimal condition. I was able to read time, and temp accurately
	|- Although time starts at 0:00 till you move the dial and then the lowest possible is 0:01 which I hope
	|- is satisfactory. The LEDS work wonders and the buttons require a bit of learning as it is a bit buggy
	|- atleast on my end.
